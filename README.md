## Current state of the system

Everything below is implemented, wired end-to-end, and covered by tests or smoke scripts.

### Production-ready

- **Auth.** Email + password (bcrypt cost 12), JWT HS256 access tokens in memory, rotating refresh tokens as **`httpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` cookies** scoped to `/api/v1/auth`. Refresh-token reuse detection revokes all user sessions. Account lockout after 10 failed attempts. TOTP 2FA with QR enrollment and 10 one-time recovery codes.
- **Products catalog + pricing engine.** Product override beats metal default, with percent *or* flat-per-troy-oz premiums. Decimal arithmetic end-to-end (`decimal.js` + `NUMERIC(20,8)`), never JS float.
- **Metals feed.** Live spot from metals.dev, Redis-cached with stale-on-upstream-failure fallback.
- **Invoices.** Create → finalize → paid → shipped state machine for both buy and sell sides. Each line item captures a full snapshot (name, gross weight, purity, metal content, spot, premium type/value, unit price, line total). **An invoice is 100% reproducible after the underlying product is hard-deleted.**
- **Admin override** on individual line items; admin role only, logged in `audit_logs`.
- **Invoice PDF** generated with pdfkit (logo upload + branding configurable in Settings).
- **Inventory with real reservation.** Sell-side `draft → finalized` reserves stock; `shipped` consumes it; `canceled` releases it. Buy-side `paid` adds stock. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the inventory row serializes concurrent finalize attempts, making oversell impossible. Weighted-average cost maintained on buy-side movements.
- **Public feed** `/public/what-we-pay`: batch-priced (~5 queries regardless of product count), Redis-cached with hook-based invalidation on product + pricing-rule changes.
- **Client portal** at `/dashboard/*` — transactions, invoice PDFs, live pricing via SSE, lock-in quotes, in-stock feed, deal requests with photo uploads, shipments with carrier tracking URLs, staff↔client messaging, 2FA setup.
- **Admin console** at `/admin/*` — dashboard with live spot ticker, clients CRM (pg_trgm fuzzy search), products, pricing rules, invoices (create wizard + status board), deal-request queue with inline photo gallery + messaging, shipments, inventory, lock-in quote converter, branding, integrations.
- **Notifications** — in-app inbox + email via nodemailer (SMTP or dev log) + SMS via Twilio (live or dev log). Per-user opt-in for email and SMS. SMS limited to high-signal events.
- **Integrations** — UPS / FedEx / USPS / DocuSign credentials configured in-app at `/admin/integrations`. AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest; secrets never leave the server (redacted in API responses, never in env). One master `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is the only secret the env needs for these.
- **Shipment adapter** layer (`ShipmentAdapter` interface). Each carrier is an isolated adapter class; `CarrierService` is a thin dispatcher. A `shipment_tracking_events` table stores normalized event history with idempotent ingestion.

### Partially implemented — structure complete, needs external keys or one last wire

- **Carrier tracking auto-refresh.** `CarrierService.track()` + `ShipmentIngestService.ingest()` are wired. Admin "Test connection" exercises the real OAuth endpoints. Background polling job is not scheduled yet — expected wiring is a cron tick calling `ShipmentIngestService.refreshShipment(id)` per active shipment.
- **Carrier webhooks.** `CarrierWebhooksController` at `/api/v1/webhooks/carriers/:carrier` is live. Each adapter's `verifyWebhook()` / `parseWebhook()` methods are optional and currently only stubs; wire them when you enroll a carrier in push delivery.
- **DocuSign.** JWT-grant token exchange + HMAC webhook verification implemented. Envelope creation / template fill path is scaffolded but not wired to the invoice finalize flow yet.
- **EasyPost.** Adapter class present as a structural placeholder.

### Deliberately not planned

- ACH rails (Plaid / Dwolla).
- Mobile app — future.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node 20.11+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker Desktop (Postgres + Redis)
- Git

### First-time

```powershell
cd E:\agc-crm
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/api/.env` and fill in:

- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` — run twice:
  ```powershell
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('base64'))"
  ```
- `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — 32 bytes base64:
  ```powershell
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
  ```
- `METALS_API_KEY` — grab from https://metals.dev

Install + boot:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm db:up
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed               # creates admin@agc.local / ChangeMe_Admin_123!
pnpm db:seed:trading       # seeds product catalog + pricing rules
```

### Run dev

Two terminals:

```powershell
pnpm api:dev    # http://localhost:4000
pnpm web:dev    # http://localhost:3001
```

Sign in at http://localhost:3001/login as `admin@agc.local` / `ChangeMe_Admin_123!` and **change the password immediately**.

---

## Running tests

Unit tests are pure and need no API:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @agc/api test:unit
```

Integration tests hit the live API and verify DB invariants. Need `pnpm api:dev` running:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @agc/api test:integration
```

Covers:
- pricing math (override precedence, percent vs flat, decimal safety)
- carrier status mapping (UPS / FedEx / USPS codes)
- invoice snapshot fidelity (gross/purity/content are three distinct values)
- invoice survives hard-DELETE of its product (totals + PDF unchanged)
- `buy.paid` → `+on_hand`
- `sell.finalized` → `+reserved` only; `sell.shipped` → consume both counters
- cancel → release reservation
- oversell rejected atomically via `SELECT FOR UPDATE`
- admin override persists `is_overridden=true` + `unit_price`
- `/public/what-we-pay` filters by `show_on_website=true`

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + typecheck + migrations + build on every push.

## Migrations

13 applied migrations. Additive only — rename/nullable changes happen in dedicated migrations that note their safety guarantee in the header comment.

| #   | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| 001 | auth: users, clients, refresh_tokens, audit_logs |
| 002 | trading: products, pricing_rules, inventory, inventory_movements, invoices, invoice_line_items |
| 003 | settings (branding, logo path) |
| 004 | portal: deal_requests, shipments, notifications |
| 005 | 2FA recovery codes, price_quotes, deal_request_photos, email prefs |
| 006 | pg_trgm fuzzy search indexes (clients, products, invoices) |
| 007 | messages (client↔staff) + phone/SMS prefs |
| 008 | integrations (encrypted credential store) |
| 009 | `invoice_line_items` column rename: `gross_weight_troy_oz`, `purity`, `metal_content_troy_oz` |
| 010 | product delete SET NULL on `invoice_line_items` + `inventory_movements` |
| 011 | `inventory_movements.reserved_delta` + reservation reason codes |
| 012 | `inventory.product_id` CASCADE; `deal_requests.product_id` SET NULL |
| 013 | `shipment_tracking_events` + idempotent unique index |

Apply:
```powershell
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:rollback   # reverts the most recent
```

## Security posture

| Area | What's enforced |
|------|-----------------|
| Password storage | bcrypt cost 12 |
| Refresh tokens | httpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax cookie, SHA-256 hashed in DB, reuse detection revokes session |
| Access tokens | JWT HS256, in memory only — never in storage or cookies |
| 2FA | TOTP + 10 single-use recovery codes |
| Login | 5/min per IP, 10 failed attempts → 15-min lock |
| Integration secrets | AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, decrypt key in env only |
| Money math | Decimal only. `NUMERIC(20,8)` on every monetary column. No JS float anywhere in pricing/invoicing/inventory |
| Oversell | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on inventory row inside the status-change transaction |
| Invoice history | Every line item snapshots every calculation input; invoices reprint identically after product hard-delete |
| Audit trail | `audit_logs` for every status change, override, portal enable/disable, password reset, integration change; `inventory_movements` for every on_hand / reserved change |
| Pre-commit | `.githooks/pre-commit` greps staged diffs for credential shapes (AWS, GitHub, Slack, Stripe, Twilio, JWT, PEM) |

---

## Deployment

`render.yaml` provisions the full stack in one blueprint: API (Docker), Postgres 16, Redis 7. `apps/web/vercel.json` deploys the Next.js frontend and rewrites `/api/*` to the Render host.

One-time:
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Render → New → Blueprint → point at the repo → fill the `sync: false` env prompts (`API_BASE_URL`, `WEB_ORIGIN`, `METALS_API_KEY`, `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SMTP_*`, `TWILIO_*`).
3. Vercel → Import → set root to `apps/web` → deploy.
4. Edit `WEB_ORIGIN` in Render to match your real Vercel URL (CORS depends on this).
5. Run migrations in the Render shell: `pnpm --filter @agc/api db:migrate`.

Post-deploy:
- Rotate the seeded admin password at `/admin/settings`, or delete the seed user.
- Enable 2FA on the admin account at `/dashboard/security`.
- Configure each integration at `/admin/integrations`.
